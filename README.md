# MNIST-Conditional Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Network-implementation
1. To run, download the zip-file [here](https://github.com/Strauman/FYS-3810-ProjectCode/archive/master.zip).
2. Unzip it
3. Enter the directory where it is unzipped
4. Make a directory called `plots`
5. Run the python file `train.py`

To switch architecture, switch line `14` in `train.py` with a different architecture by function name from `model.py`.


**Note:** If you are not sent here from the report, you should know this code is accompanied by a report that is not allowed to publicly published. This code should run anyways and is a Keras implementation of CDCGAN on the MNIST dataset.

## Edits after deadline
Here is a list of what has happened since the deadline.
- Made it easier to train models with different architectures
- Multiple updates of this description
